## About Me

I am a **Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Ottawa**. My research focuses on **pure computer vision** and the **integration of AI into immersive 3D worlds**, including the development of **AI-powered avatars** and **interactive virtual environments**.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my **Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering** at **Islamia College Peshawar** in 2021, where I developed expertise in **medical imaging** and **computer vision** alongside a strong foundation in software development and engineering principles.

## News
- **[Sept. 2025]** Started Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at **University of Ottawa**.
- **[2023-2024]** Worked on **Real-Time Violence Detection** system at **MBZUAI** in collaboration with **Technology Innovation Institute (TII)**.
- **[2021-2023]** Developed **EmotionVis** - Facial Expression Recognition system for neurological patients at **DIP Lab, Islamia College Peshawar** in collaboration with **NTNU** (Norwegian University of Science and Technology).

## Projects

### WudFlux
A web-based metaverse application featuring AI-powered professor avatars. Users can interact through audio or text, receiving natural responses to questions and queries in an immersive 3D virtual environment accessible through any browser.

### DebateVerse
A fully autonomous debate system where two AI avatars engage in structured debates on given topics. Features intelligent moderator guidance, reference-supported arguments, and ensures proper engagement between debaters in real-time discussions.

### Real-Time Violence Detection
Real-time violence detection system optimized for edge devices. Collaboration between Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and Technology Innovation Institute (TII). Deployed on Jetson Nano with model optimization techniques for efficient inference and resource-constrained deployment in real-world surveillance applications.

### EmotionVis
Facial Expression Recognition system for monitoring neurological patients like Parkinson's disease. Worked on training adaptive models for pain assessment and emotion monitoring under supervision of Dr. Sajjad at DIP Lab, Islamia College Peshawar. NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) collaboration funded by Alameda AI toolkit.
